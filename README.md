# GoonLicence

On 26 October 2023 the UK Governement passed an act of Parliament to designate and suppress a wide range of online content that is deemed illegal or harmful to children.  The problem with the act is that it blocks online resources to LGBT+ Resources, general online websites related to things like quitting smoking and even access to Discord in some cases. 

There has been a meme for years regarding the UK requirement for a TV Licence, kids in England getting their "pen" licence and as of 2025 you now have a legal requirement to show your governement ID or a "selfie" to prove you are of age to view certain content - hence, the gooner licence.

# Privacy
The upload of a governement issued ID to websites to validate your age in itself is a horrendous idea, but the even bigger issue is the data is being transferred out of the United Kingdom.  Websites like Reddit and a certain adult website with an orange and black logo is having it's users upload their ID to an age verification service that is based in the United States, the UK Gov. do not care about your privacy or you, they care about making it look like they care.

# GoonLicence Privacy
This entire website is client side.  No images are uploaded to a server, no images are generated on a server.  It's all done client side, nothing is stored, I have no way of knowing who used it nor will I ever.  I uploaded it to GitHub Pages so anyone can view the source code and raise a merge request as they see fit to ensure that nothing dodgy is going on.  Your data is yours, I don't want it.

Enjoy gooning. ðŸ«¡

This isn't an actual licence lmao.  If you somehow get an age verification service to accept it please send it to me at goon@laim.scot.
